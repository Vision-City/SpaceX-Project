# SpaceX-Project
IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Project

This capstone project, which is the culmination of the IBM Applied Data Science program, reflects what data scientists do when working with real datasets. In this project, the premise is to take the role of a Data Scientist working for a space launch startup intending to compete with SpaceX. To determine a competitive price for each rocket launch, we need to gather information about Space X and create dashboards for the team. A key part is to train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. All this will need many aspects of Data Science methodology - data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting the final results to stakeholders.
